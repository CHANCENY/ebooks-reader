			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55" class="chapter-number"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"></a>4</h1>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"></a>Drupal Community</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor086"></a>While Drupal itself is an extensible enterprise digital technology, the community behind Drupal is its true superpower. Effectively harnessing the community, its tools, and its practices helps any developer become better at Drupal. The community builds Drupal and contributes its experience and code to make Drupal better. Without a vast and healthy community, Drupal wouldn’t be what it is today. This chapter aims to help you better understand the community while stressing the importance of everyone contributing their experience to sustain and shape the <span class="No-Break">Drupal project.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the open <span class="No-Break">source community</span></li>
				<li>Projects <span class="No-Break">on Drupal.org</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"></a>Understanding the open-source community</h1>
			<p>Drupal’s biggest <a id="_idIndexMarker108"></a>strength is the community behind it. Unlike proprietary software, which has developers paid to build and maintain it, Drupal leverages its active, open-source community. Understanding how to work with the community is critical to working with Drupal and to keeping <span class="No-Break">it vibrant.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor088"></a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"></a>Drupal.org basics</h2>
			<p>Drupal.org is one of the primary<a id="_idIndexMarker109"></a> places where the community engages. The following figure shows the initial Drupal.org landing page, which provides a high-level direction for those interested <span class="No-Break">in Drupal:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19491_04_1.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Drupal.org home page" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Drupal.org home page</p>
			<p>The figure <a id="_idIndexMarker110"></a>shows a lot of relevant information, starting with the top menu, which can help direct you to useful starting points. <strong class="bold">Why Drupal?</strong> and <strong class="bold">Solutions</strong> capture useful marketing materialfor different types of users in the community. <strong class="bold">Build</strong> helps direct community members toward projects and issue queues that help create Drupal applications. Community information is found in <strong class="bold">Community Resources</strong>, <strong class="bold">Give</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Events</strong>. One can also find useful links in the footer and throughout Drupal.org, such as security advisories, licensing information, jobs, and more. Drupal.org is a fairly complete resource for the community to collaborate with maintainers, suggest improvements, surface issues, find help, and contribute. Becoming familiar with this tool is imperative to learning Drupal. It can take time to learn the Drupal concepts and terminology that are important to how the community engages. However, harnessing Drupal.org is the single biggest tool for self-help, as you can readily find solutions to issues and benefit from others who are <a id="_idIndexMarker111"></a>also using Drupal. If you get stuck, go to Drupal.org, as there is a high likelihood that others have encountered the same issue. Also, create an account on Drupal.org so you can join in <span class="No-Break">and participat<a id="_idTextAnchor090"></a>e.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"></a>Core on Drupal.org</h2>
			<p>A project<a id="_idIndexMarker112"></a> is how Drupal organizes its open-source code, documentation, issues, and more. Core is a special type of project that differentiates between contributed modules, themes, distributions, and community projects. While Drupal core is the foundation of all Drupal applications, it still shares elements of all projects <span class="No-Break">for consistency.</span></p>
			<p>The following figure shows<a id="_idIndexMarker113"></a> Drupal core’s <span class="No-Break">project page:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19491_04_2.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Drupal core project page" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2 – Drupal core project page</p>
			<p>Like other project pages, this<a id="_idIndexMarker114"></a> one features core maintainers, issue queues, releases, and more. This consistency with other projects, as demonstrated in the example project in <a href="B19491_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, helps the community to collaborate and engage in the same way across core and <span class="No-Break">contributed proje<a id="_idTextAnchor092"></a>cts.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"></a>Core contribution</h2>
			<p>Core has<a id="_idIndexMarker115"></a> something for all community members to contribute to. For beginners, issues in the core often have the most visibility and support from other community members and subsequently can be a great tool for learning. The technical core contribution goes through the most rigor, given that the core is foundational for every Drupal install and that changes must be managed carefully. While this may seem more difficult, it is the best way to get acclimated to Drupal’s contribution. Processes are in place to ensure that automated testing coverage exists and that all tests pass. While this requires more care and may seem overly rigorous, it helps Drupal adopters avoid introducing bugs that could be caused even by simple changes. The significant positive impact of this contribution should be welcomed by <span class="No-Break">all contributors.</span></p>
			<p>However, Drupal core has established processes to evolve thoughtfully. Minor versions often maintain the same platform requirements and core dependencies while releasing ongoing improvements and additional planned features. Major versions are for larger changes. Applications can often expect a clean and easy upgrade path for minor core updates. Major updates often demand platform changes, upgrade Drupal core’s dependent components, and commit code-level framework deprecations introduced from the previous minor version. This is a larger task but one that affords added value, new features, continued community support, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p>Drupal core<a id="_idIndexMarker116"></a> provides the foundational features and framework that run the application. The next sections will highlight more about the purpose of these features and how to <span class="No-Break">build applica<a id="_idTextAnchor094"></a>tions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"></a>Projects on Drupal.org</h2>
			<p>Understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker117"></a>projects on Drupal.org is a must for anyone developing with<a id="_idIndexMarker118"></a> Drupal. The next chapter will go into great depth on what a project is; basically, projects extend Drupal’s out-of-the-box behavior for explicit use cases. Drupal core, which is its out-of-the-box foundation, is also a project on Drupal.org. Harnessing contributed projects is one of the most valuable aspects of Drupal, and learning how to discover projects is critical to realizing the value of the open-source community instead of just diving into development. This approach harnesses the collective talent and excellence of the community (also known as “standing on the shoulders <span class="No-Break">of giants”).</span></p>
			<p>Drupal.org is the home of all community projects and is perpetually evolving. Projects are routinely created or updated, as are the documentation (content), features, and experience found on Drupal.org. Some of the figures shared may routinely change through updates or changes to Drupal itself, but the core principles outlined in this chapter, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker119"></a>book <a id="_idIndexMarker120"></a>more generally, remain true. The following figure demonstrates a <span class="No-Break">project page:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19491_04_3.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Project pages on Drupal.org" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3 – Project pages on Drupal.org</p>
			<p>The figure <a id="_idIndexMarker121"></a>shows <a id="_idIndexMarker122"></a>one example project page, which features the primary content as well as the content in the sidebar. The primary content has the project title (<strong class="bold">Password Policy</strong>) and description (text under the title) to summarize the purpose of the project. This description is often the starting point for evaluating whether a project will or won’t solve a specific problem. Project releases are found at the bottom of the page. The sidebar shows the maintainers and offers links to the documentation, source code, and issue queues. Maintainers are listed as the points of contact for <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></p>
			<p>Every project has an issue queue, as shown in the following figure, for community engagement and the organization of <span class="No-Break">planned work:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19491_04_4.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – Project issue queues on Drupal.org" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.4 – Project issue queues on Drupal.org</p>
			<p>The figure demonstrates the basics of a project’s issue queue for a specific project, <strong class="bold">Password Policy</strong>. Filters at the top of the issue queue are helpful, as each filter can differentiate the status of the issue, compatibility with the major version of Drupal, the type of issue, and more. The issue queues are searchable and sortable to help look for keywords and order by priority. If you have a problem using a project, check the queue. For widely used projects, there is a high likelihood that an issue may already exist for a challenge <span class="No-Break">you face.</span></p>
			<p>The next figure <a id="_idIndexMarker123"></a>shows an <a id="_idIndexMarker124"></a>example of a Drupal issue where community members help manage project code, collaborate on specific requests, <span class="No-Break">and more:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19491_04_5.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – A sample project issue on Drupal.org" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.5 – A sample project issue on Drupal.org</p>
			<p>After logging in, community members can both update an issue and engage in comments at the bottom of an issue, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19491_04_6.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Collaborating within a project issue on Drupal.org" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.6 – Collaborating within a project issue on Drupal.org</p>
			<p>Issues are <a id="_idIndexMarker125"></a>composed of titles, summaries, metadata, and comments. An accordion exists for the <a id="_idIndexMarker126"></a>primary-issue metadata. The categories of <strong class="bold">Bug report</strong>, <strong class="bold">Plan</strong>, <strong class="bold">Support request</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Feature request</strong> all have different semantics that categorize the intent of the issue filed. Dropdowns exist for the priority, the status of the issue, the user assigned, and the impacted component. Issue summaries help describe the purpose and context of an issue and comments are used for discussion. Issues also offer instructions for contributing code to fix the issue. Some projects have Drupal.org’s merge request workflows enabled. If not, they will show standard commands to propose changes. Finally, users can link related issues that are helpful for historical conversations or dependent work. Project maintainers are the stewards of issues and their projects and are often active in collaboration and decision-making when considering an issue filed. A crediting system exists where maintainers can credit contributors for their efforts. Community members can gain greater exposure for individuals<a id="_idIndexMarker127"></a> and their supporting <a id="_idIndexMarker128"></a>organizations, gaining direct results from contributing to the b<a id="_idTextAnchor096"></a>enefit <span class="No-Break">of all.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"></a>Contribution impact</h2>
			<p>Drupal developers often have to<a id="_idIndexMarker129"></a> address unique requirements in their created applications. In building the application, developers may run into new use cases, find bugs, or find limitations based on their experience. This experience serves as an opportunity for contribution, and every project on Drupal.org has an issue queue that allows people to contribute based on <span class="No-Break">their experience.</span></p>
			<p>The impact can be noteworthy. Take Drupal Commerce<a id="_idIndexMarker130"></a> as one example. Built on top of Drupal, Commerce is a set of fundamental features, such as a cart and products, combined with a highly extensible framework. The framework was designed to offer third-party integration with different payment processors, the ability to satisfy additional optional use cases such as fulfillment, and more. Community members have not only submitted fixes to bugs with Commerce itself but have contributed integrations for over 132 different payment gateways, such as Stripe, PayPal, Amazon Pay, and more. Community members also built complementary features for subscription management (recurring payment models), coupons (promotions), managing taxes, and shipping capabilities. The net result of these contributions has yielded a robust ecosystem of Commerce capabilities built on Drupal and its content management capabilities to deliver effective <span class="No-Break">digital storefronts.</span></p>
			<p>Contributions provide opportunities to help the Drupal ecosystem. Even the smallest of changes can make a material impact across a significant range of installed Drupal applications or benefit the vast Drupal community. Each community member has the chance to share their experience and to use that experience to<a id="_idTextAnchor098"></a> <span class="No-Break">improve Drupal.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"></a>Other community resources and tools</h1>
			<p>The Drupal<a id="_idIndexMarker131"></a> community engages in other ways that help foster collaboration. Discussion commonly happens on Drupal Slack (<strong class="source-inline">drupal.org/slack</strong>). General and specific channels exist that are tied to getting help, specific projects, or specific topics that span both professional and social subjects. Drupal camps and conferences, most prominently the global conference known<a id="_idIndexMarker132"></a> as DrupalCon, bring the community together through sessions, supported contributions, and social events. Some regions hold local events and meetups. Finally, community members routinely write blogs, engage in social networks, and <span class="No-Break">join podcasts.</span></p>
			<p>The Drupal Association<a id="_idIndexMarker133"></a> is a US-based non-profit organization tasked with “uniting the global open source community to build, secure, and promote Drupal.” They run Drupal.org, maintain the project’s infrastructure, host DrupalCon, and lead strategic programs. While their responsibilities do not overlap with the vision of the Drupal project or hands-on contributions to the project itself, the Drupal Association is a critical enabler. As a resource for the community, they serve in other ways, such as governance, oversight of the code of conduct, and executing improvements to the infrastructure that aids in contribution <span class="No-Break">or testing.</span></p>
			<p>The broader<a id="_idIndexMarker134"></a> community surrounding Drupal is both vast and inspiring. Between Drupal.org content, projects, issues, events, Slack, and the Drupal Association, there are endless resources available to community members to engage, learn, grow, and contribute. The community and resources that enable this are why Drupal stands out as one of the largest and longest-standing open-source projects. The community has engaged to collaborate on building Drupal, identifying and fixing issues, contributing meaningful add-ons that extend Drupal, and helping others become <span class="No-Break">tech<a id="_idTextAnchor100"></a>nical professionals.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter covered a review of Drupal.org and provided an introduction to engaging with the community, working with community projects, and the purpose of the Drupal Association. All of these are important to effectively harness one of Drupal’s best assets: its community. The next chapter covers what is new in <span class="No-Break">Drupal 10.</span></p>
