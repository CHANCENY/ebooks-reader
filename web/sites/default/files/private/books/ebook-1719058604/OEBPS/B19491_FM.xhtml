			<p><strong class="bold">Mike Herchel</strong>, author of <span class="No-Break">Chapter 19</span>, is the primary developer behind Drupal’s default theme (called Olivero), as well as a maintainer of Drupal core’s CSS subsystem. He’s on a crusade to improve Drupal’s front-end developer experience for those new to the Drupal ecosystem. If you have feedback on this, or thoughts on what’s hard to accomplish, please reach out to him at mike@herchel.com. The work on this chapter was traded for beer, and in fact, if you find Mike at a local DrupalCamp, you can typically get him to do core development in exchange <span class="No-Break">for beer.</span></p>
