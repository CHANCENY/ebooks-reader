			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>Preface</h1>
			<p>Thank you for choosing this book. Digital experience is the broad set of ways users can engage through a website, online shopping, apps, and more. Drupal is an open source digital framework used to create digital experiences. Incepted as a content management system built on structured content models, Drupal’s flexibility, extensibility, and evolution has positioned Drupal to serve the broader digital space. Drupal’s interoperability allows it to work with other things like social media networks, CRM systems, technical capabilities, apps, and even internet-of-things connected devices. Drupal is known for its configuration layer that enables no-code modification through an administrative user interface. The extensibility allows Drupal to be customized both functionally and visually through a robust development framework that often appeals to enterprise use cases. The community maintains both the core of Drupal and a large series of modular projects that can be readily installed, if desired for a <span class="No-Break">given installation.</span></p>
			<p>There are many books on Drupal, several of which dive deep in a specific way. This doesn’t reflect the experience I’ve had with Drupal, in which I have been asked to solve a large number of problems that have spanned every aspect of Drupal that have spanned various Drupal agencies and companies that build products supporting Drupal applications. My <span class="No-Break">experience covers:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Participating in the community</li>
				<li>Installing Drupal</li>
				<li>Evaluating/installing Drupal projects</li>
				<li>Configuring features</li>
				<li>Writing code through modules and themes</li>
				<li>Deploying updates</li>
				<li>Running/configuring Drupal’s technology stack</li>
				<li>Dependent and complementary technologies</li>
				<li>Broader DevOps implementations, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Drupal continues to be one of the longest standing and largest open source communities. Community members are often in high demand to help companies advise, build, maintain, or upgrade Drupal. Drupal affords continuous opportunities to learn through its community, which is always at the ready to help find important work, coach new community members, and ultimately, help members grow <span class="No-Break">as technologists.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>Such a broad and capable digital platform covers a large number of technologies and skillsets. This book aims to introduce as much of Drupal as possible to help gain exposure spanning <span class="No-Break">several personas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">End user</strong> : Elements of the book highlight the experience offered to website visitors or content authors who engage with Drupal but don’t necessarily build it</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site builder</strong> : A user who can install and configure Drupal without custom code</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Backend developer</strong> : A user who can customize Drupal functionality through its development framework with modules</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Front-end developer</strong> : A user who can customize Drupal’s visual appearance through its development framework with themes</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Systems administrator</strong> : A user who needs to help maintain Drupal’s technology stack and servers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The book is heavy in content for the site builder persona, given it is a foundational persona. Customization is not expected or desired until after a site builder has exhausted no-code configuration for a Drupal application. Several chapters then explore the more advanced topics around customized code through Drupal’s framework, tooling, and <span class="No-Break">deployment mechanisms.</span></p>

			<p>Local tools, like DDEV (<a href="https://ddev.com/">https://ddev.com/</a>), help run a containerized application that hosts Drupal. There are active discussions on DDEV becoming the community standard. Such a tool provides a well documented experience and commands to run Drupal applications. Given this book has several hands-on examples, a local container-based tool brings automation and the ability to destroy and rebuild a Drupal application rapidly. DDEV is also supported across several <span class="No-Break">operating systems.</span></p>
			<p>This book tries to not be too opinionated. The Drupal community, like any community, often has more than one way to solve a problem and it has passionate, smart people that may not always agree. Efforts were made while writing this book to remain objective while trying to give readers as much context on topics as possible. It will be important to get informed on the basics from this book, form your own opinions, and be opportunistic <span class="No-Break">in learning.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Conventions used</h1>

Here is an example: “Create a <strong class="source-inline">*.services.yml</strong> file within the root directory of <span class="No-Break">the module.”</span></p>
			<p>A block of code is set <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
use Drupal\user\Entity\User;
$user = User::load(\Drupal::currentUser()-&gt;id());</pre>			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set <span class="No-Break">in bold:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
namespace <strong class="bold">Drupal\my_module</strong>\Service;</pre>			<p>Any command-line input or output is written <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
